# Ski Trip Planner
Outside of technology, skiing is my passion and planning ski trips can get stressful. There is always uncertainty when planning a trip to a new ski town. Will there be enough snow? Is it close to an airport? Does it get crowded? If so, is the resort large enough to avoid the crowds or are the other resorts near by? I created Ski Trip Planner to give users the tools to make an informed decision about their next trip, or share past experiences.
