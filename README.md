# Ski Trip Planner

### Description

The goal of this project was to build a full-stack server application. Outside of technology, skiing is my passion and planning ski trips can get stressful. There is always uncertainty when planning a trip to a new ski town. Will there be enough snow? Is it close to an airport? Does it get crowded? If so, is the resort large enough to avoid the crowds or are there other resorts nearby? I created Ski Trip Planner to give users the tools to make an informed decision about their next trip, or share past experiences.
